# CleanUp LinkedIn
CleanUp LinkedIn is a chrome extension for cleaning your Li feed.

Do you want to stop LinkedIn from showing you so many ads and other clutter?  I built this extension because I wanted to get rid of all the rubbish in my LinkedIn feed.  Here's a few things you can choose to remove from your feed:
 - Remove ads or "Promoted" posts
 - Remove "Events recommended for you" notifications
 - Remove "Add to your feed" or "You may also be interested in" suggestions
 - Remove "Fresh Perspectives"
 - Remove "Jobs recommended for you"

You can also choose to clean your entire feed, leaving you with a blank space to give you room to breathe.  An in-feed reminder will also remind you that the extension is running.

All of the above are options, and you can block or unblock these options at any time, depending on what you want to see.

Click on the extensions toolbar to open the options popup.   Here, you can simply tick anything you don't want to see, load (or reload) LinkedIn.com and start enjoying a clean, relevant feed without ads and annoyances.

This plugin is fast and easy to use.  Enjoy :)

4. Once installed, you can access it differently depending on your browser.  By default, Google Chrome won't show the extension directly:
